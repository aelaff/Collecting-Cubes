# Collecting-Cubes
# Summary
This game aims to collect all the cubes and deliver them to a certain point to move to the next stage.
I designed the game algorithm so that the stages are formed by reading images using pixel technology, where I convert each pixel in the image into a cube that has the same color as the pixel, and we exclude the empty pixels.
